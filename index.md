## Biography

I am a PhD Candidate supervised by 
<a href="https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/marco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. M. Zuniga</a>, 
<a href="https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/qing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Q. Wang</a> and
<a href="http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/koen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. dr. K.G. Langendoen</a> at the 
<a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/embedded-and-networked-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Embedded and Networked Systems group</a>.

Currently my reseach interests focus on biometric authentication. 
Biometric authentication is a security process that relies on the unique biological characteristics of an individual to verify that he is who is says he is.
Following the pervasive usage of smartphone, biometric authentication is highly involved in our daily life. 
The popular access granted methods, like fingertip, iris and face, are in the domain of biometric authentication. 
Now my reseach direction aims to seek a more secure methods comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. 
In this aspect, we will faciliate the knowledage of data processing and machine learning.

In addition, I have some research experience on visible light communication, which is also an interesting topic for me. 

## Research interests
1. Biometric authentication
2. Visible light communication
3. Dimensionality reduction

## Personal interests
1. Play, watch and organize football game
